# Spam_Detection
-Spam Filter is Designed on Paradigm of Naive-Bayes

-Bayesian Models works on Events which are Dependent of Each other at different levels

-The Spam Filter Designed is based on independent cases i.e the words are not dependent on each other that is reason we use "Naive-Bayes" which is kind of Subset of Bayes Theorem where the events are independent of each other   

-P(Spam|Free) = (P(Spam)*P(Free|Spam))/P(Free)

-Note : P(Free) = P(Free|Spam)*P(Spam) + P(Free|Ham)*P(Ham) -----> Ham = Not Spam
